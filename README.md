## 📝 Content Management

### Updating Network Section

Edit `src/components/Sections/NetworkSection.tsx` to add/update consultant profiles:

```typescript
const consultants = [
  { name: "Name", role: "Role Title", image: null },
  // Add more consultants
];
```

### Updating Portfolio Section

Edit `src/components/Sections/PortfolioSection.tsx` to add/update projects:

```typescript
const projects = [
  {
    icon: <Icon />,
    title: "Project Title",
    description: "Project description",
    tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2"],
  },
  // Add more projects
];
```

### Form Submission

The contact form in `src/components/ContactForm/QuoteModal.tsx` currently logs to console. To integrate with your backend:

1. Replace the `onSubmit` function with your API endpoint
2. Or integrate with services like Formspree, Netlify Forms, or EmailJS

Example with fetch:
```typescript
const onSubmit = async (data: FormData) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/contact', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
  });
  // Handle response
};
```

## 🚀 Deployment to Netlify

### Method 1: GitHub Integration (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and sign in
3. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
4. Connect to GitHub and select your repository
5. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
   - Leave other settings as default
6. Click "Deploy site"

### Method 2: Netlify CLI

1. Install Netlify CLI:
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

2. Build your site:

## 🌐 Connecting Your Squarespace Domain

1. In Netlify, go to your site settings → "Domain management"
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Enter your domain name
4. Netlify will provide you with DNS settings
5. In Squarespace:
   - Go to Settings → Domains → [Your Domain] → DNS Settings
   - Add the DNS records provided by Netlify
   - This typically includes:
     - A record pointing to Netlify's IP
     - CNAME record for www subdomain
6. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours, usually much faster)
7. Enable HTTPS in Netlify (automatic after DNS verification)

### DNS Records Example:
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 75.2.60.5 (Netlify's load balancer IP)

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: your-site-name.netlify.app
```
