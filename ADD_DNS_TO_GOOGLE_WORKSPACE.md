## üéØ Step-by-Step: Add to Google Workspace

### **STEP 1: Open Google Workspace Admin Console**

1. Go to: **https://admin.google.com**
2. Sign in with: **ethan@myconsulting.network**
3. You should see the Admin console dashboard

---

### **STEP 2: Navigate to DNS Settings**

**Option A: Using Left Menu**
1. Click **"Domains"** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"Manage domains"**
3. Click on **myconsulting.network**
4. Click **"Manage DNS"** or **"DNS"** button

**Option B: Using Search**
1. Use the search bar at top

3. Click on DNS settings for myconsulting.network

**Option C: Direct Link**
Try this URL:
```
https://admin.google.com/ac/domains/manage/myconsulting.network
```

---

### **STEP 3: Update the A Record**

**You currently have (from Squarespace):**
```
Host: @
Type: A
Data: 198.49.23.144
```

**Change it to (Google Cloud Run):**
```
Host: @
Type: A
Data: 216.239.32.21
```

**How to do it:**
1. Find the A record in the DNS list
2. Look for: Host `@`, Type `A`, Value `198.49.23.144`
3. Click **Edit** or the pencil icon
4. Change the value from `198.49.23.144` to `216.239.32.21`
5. Keep TTL as is (probably 3600 or 1 hour)
6. Click **Save** or **Update**

---

### **STEP 4: Add AAAA Record**

1. Click **"Add record"** or **"Add DNS record"** or **"Create new record"**
2. Fill in:
   - **Type:** AAAA
   - **Host:** @ (or leave blank if it says "root")
   - **Value/Data:** `2001:4860:4802:32::15`
   - **TTL:** 3600 (or 1 hour)
3. Click **Save** or **Add**

---

### **STEP 5: Verify MX Records Are Still There**

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL:** Make sure you still have these MX records for email!

```
Type: MX, Priority: 1,  Host: @, Value: smtp.google.com
(or the standard Google Workspace MX records)
```

**DO NOT delete any:**
- MX records (email)
- TXT records (verification, SPF, DKIM)
- CNAME records (unless they conflict)

**ONLY change:**
- A record (from Squarespace IP to Cloud Run IP)
- Add new AAAA record

---

## ‚úÖ What Your DNS Should Look Like After Changes

### **Must Have:**
```
@ A     216.239.32.21                     (Cloud Run - NEW/UPDATED)
@ AAAA  2001:4860:4802:32::15            (Cloud Run - NEW)
@ MX    1 smtp.google.com                (Email - KEEP)
@ TXT   google-site-verification=...     (Verification - KEEP)
@ TXT   v=DKIM1...                       (Email - KEEP)
```

### **Can Have (optional):**
```
www CNAME ext-sq.squarespace.com         (Can change or remove)
```

## ‚è∞ After Adding Records

### **DNS Propagation Time:**
- **Minimum:** 15 minutes
- **Typical:** 1-2 hours
- **Maximum:** 24-48 hours

### **What Happens:**
1. ‚úÖ You save changes in Google Workspace Admin
2. üîÑ DNS changes propagate across the internet
3. ‚è≥ Wait for propagation (automatic)
4. ‚úÖ Your domain starts pointing to Cloud Run
5. üîí Google automatically provisions SSL certificate
6. üéâ Your site is live at https://myconsulting.network

---

## üß™ Test After Propagation

### **Check DNS Propagation:**

**Online Tool:**
1. Go to: https://whatsmydns.net
2. Enter: `myconsulting.network`
3. Select: A record
4. Check if it shows: `216.239.32.21`

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Check A record
nslookup myconsulting.network

# Should eventually show: 216.239.32.21
```

### **Check Your Website:**

Once DNS propagates, test:
```
https://myconsulting.network
```

Should show your website with green padlock (SSL)!

---

## üìß Test Email Still Works

After DNS changes:
1. **Send** a test email from @myconsulting.network
2. **Receive** a test email at @myconsulting.network
3. Both should work normally

**If email stops working:**
- Check that MX records are still present
- Wait for DNS propagation
- May take up to 48 hours

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **Can't Find DNS Settings in Google Workspace?**

Try these locations:
1. **Home** ‚Üí **Domains** ‚Üí **Manage domains** ‚Üí myconsulting.network ‚Üí **DNS**
2. **Apps** ‚Üí **Google Workspace** ‚Üí **Settings for Gmail** ‚Üí **Advanced**
3. Search for "DNS" in the admin console search bar

### **Can't Edit A Record?**

If you see a message about Squarespace managing the domain:
- This is expected - you're taking control back
- Just edit the record anyway - Google Workspace allows it
- The warning just means Squarespace was managing it before

### **Don't See "Add Record" Button?**

Look for:
- "Create new record"
- "Add DNS record"
- "+" icon
- "Add" button at bottom of record list

### **A Record vs. AAAA Record?**

- **A record:** IPv4 address (like 216.239.32.21)
- **AAAA record:** IPv6 address (like 2001:4860:4802:32::15)
- **You need BOTH** for best compatibility
