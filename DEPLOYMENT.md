Create `netlify.toml` in project root:

```toml
[build]

  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"

## üîÑ Continuous Deployment

Once connected to GitHub, Netlify automatically:
- Deploys on every push to `main` branch
- Creates preview deployments for pull requests
- Runs build checks before deployment

### To Deploy Updates:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update website content"
git push origin main
```

Netlify will auto-deploy in 2-3 minutes.

## üß™ Testing Before Production

### Preview Deployment:

```bash
netlify deploy
```

This creates a preview URL to test before going live.

### Production Deployment:

```bash
netlify deploy --prod
```

Only use this after testing preview.

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Netlify

**Error:** "Module not found"
- **Fix:** Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Run `npm install` locally to verify

**Error:** "Build exceeded memory limit"
- **Fix:** Upgrade Netlify plan or optimize build

**Error:** TypeScript errors
- **Fix:** Run `npm run build` locally first to catch errors

### Domain Not Working

**Check DNS Propagation:**
```bash
nslookup yourdomain.com
```

Should return Netlify's IP address.

**Clear DNS Cache:**
- Windows: `ipconfig /flushdns`
- Mac: `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache`
- Linux: `sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches`

### SSL Certificate Issues

- Wait 24 hours after DNS configuration
- Ensure DNS is properly configured
- Try "Renew certificate" in Netlify dashboard
