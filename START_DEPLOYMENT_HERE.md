## üéØ Your Simple 3-Step Path to Launch

### Step 1: Install Tools (15 minutes)
### Step 2: Deploy to Google Cloud (10 minutes)
### Step 3: Connect Your Domain (5 minutes + waiting)

Let's go! üëá

---

## üì¶ STEP 1: Install Required Tools

### 1.1: Install Google Cloud CLI

**Windows (PowerShell):**
1. Download from: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
2. Run the installer
3. Follow the prompts
4. Restart PowerShell

**Or use Chocolatey:**
```powershell
choco install gcloudsdk
```

**Verify installation:**
```powershell
gcloud --version
```

You should see version information. ‚úÖ

---

### 1.2: Set Up Google Cloud Account

**A. Create Google Cloud Account:**
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Sign in with your Google Workspace account (same account as myconsulting.network)
3. Accept terms if this is your first time

**B. Enable Billing:**
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/billing
2. Click "Create billing account" or "Link billing account"
3. Add payment method (credit card)
4. **Don't worry:** You get $300 free credit + free tier after that
5. **Expected cost:** $0-5/month (usually $0)

---

## üöÄ STEP 2: Deploy Your Website

### 2.1: Authenticate with Google Cloud

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
# Log in to Google Cloud
gcloud auth login
```

This opens your browser. Sign in with the same account you used above.

---

### 2.2: Create Your Project

```powershell
# Create project
gcloud projects create myconsulting-network --name="MyConsulting Network"

# Set as active project
gcloud config set project myconsulting-network
```

---

### 2.3: Link Billing

```powershell
# List your billing accounts
gcloud billing accounts list
```

You'll see output like:
```
ACCOUNT_ID          NAME           OPEN
123456-789ABC-DEF   My Billing     True
```

**Copy your ACCOUNT_ID**, then run:

```powershell
# Replace YOUR-BILLING-ID with the ACCOUNT_ID from above
gcloud billing projects link myconsulting-network --billing-account=YOUR-BILLING-ID
```

---

### 2.4: Enable Required APIs

```powershell
# Enable Cloud Run, Container Registry, and Cloud Build
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com containerregistry.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com
```

This takes 1-2 minutes. ‚è≥

---

### 2.5: Deploy the Website!

```powershell
# Navigate to your project folder
cd D:\myco-website

# Deploy (this does everything!)
gcloud run deploy myconsulting-network --source . --region=us-central1 --allow-unauthenticated
```

**What happens:**
1. Builds your website ‚è≥ (3-5 minutes)
2. Creates Docker container üì¶
3. Uploads to Google Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è
4. Deploys to Cloud Run üöÄ
5. Gives you a URL üåê

**First deployment takes 5-10 minutes. Get coffee! ‚òï**

---

### 2.6: Get Your Website URL

After deployment completes, run:

```powershell
gcloud run services describe myconsulting-network --region=us-central1 --format='value(status.url)'
```

You'll get a URL like:
```
https://myconsulting-network-xxxxx-uc.a.run.app
```

**Open this URL in your browser!** üéâ

Your website is now live (on a temporary URL).

---

## üåê STEP 3: Connect Your Custom Domain

### 3.1: Map Domain in Google Cloud

```powershell
# Map your main domain
gcloud run domain-mappings create --service=myconsulting-network --domain=myconsulting.network --region=us-central1

# Map www subdomain
gcloud run domain-mappings create --service=myconsulting-network --domain=www.myconsulting.network --region=us-central1
```

---

### 3.2: Get DNS Records

```powershell
# Get the DNS values you need to add to Squarespace
gcloud run domain-mappings describe myconsulting.network --region=us-central1
```

You'll see output like:
```
resourceRecords:
- name: myconsulting.network
  type: A
  rrdata: 216.239.32.21
- name: myconsulting.network
  type: AAAA
  rrdata: 2001:4860:4802:32::15
```

**Write these down!** üìù You need them for the next step.

---

### 3.3: Update DNS in Squarespace

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: DO NOT DELETE YOUR EMAIL (MX) RECORDS!**

1. **Log in to Squarespace:**
   - Go to: https://account.squarespace.com
   - Navigate to your domain: **myconsulting.network**
   - Click **DNS Settings**

2. **Add A Record:**
   - Type: **A**
   - Host: **@** (or blank)
   - Value: **[IP from step 3.2]** (e.g., 216.239.32.21)
   - TTL: **3600**
   - Click **Save**

3. **Add AAAA Record:**
   - Type: **AAAA**
   - Host: **@** (or blank)
   - Value: **[IPv6 from step 3.2]** (e.g., 2001:4860:4802:32::15)
   - TTL: **3600**
   - Click **Save**

4. **Add/Update CNAME Record:**
   - Type: **CNAME**
   - Host: **www**
   - Value: **ghs.googlehosted.com**
   - TTL: **3600**
   - Click **Save**

5. **Verify MX Records Are Still There:**
   - Check that you still have MX records for:
     - aspmx.l.google.com (priority 1)
     - alt1.aspmx.l.google.com (priority 5)
     - alt2.aspmx.l.google.com (priority 5)
     - alt3.aspmx.l.google.com (priority 10)
     - alt4.aspmx.l.google.com (priority 10)
   - **If any are missing, ADD THEM BACK!**

‚Üí See **[SQUARESPACE_DNS_SETUP.md](SQUARESPACE_DNS_SETUP.md)**

---

### 3.4: Wait for DNS Propagation

**How long?** 1-24 hours (usually 1-2 hours)

**Check progress:**
- Visit: https://whatsmydns.net
- Enter: **myconsulting.network**
- Select: **A** record
- See if it shows your Google Cloud IP

**While you wait:**
- ‚úÖ Your site is already live at the Cloud Run URL
- ‚úÖ SSL certificate is being generated (automatic)
- ‚úÖ Nothing else to do - just wait!

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 4: Verify Everything Works

### Once DNS propagates (1-24 hours later):

**Website Checks:**
- [ ] Visit **https://myconsulting.network** - loads correctly
- [ ] Visit **https://www.myconsulting.network** - loads correctly
- [ ] Green padlock in browser (SSL certificate)
- [ ] All navigation links work
- [ ] Contact form submits successfully
- [ ] Mobile menu works on phone

**Email Checks:**
- [ ] Send email from **@myconsulting.network** - works
- [ ] Receive email at **@myconsulting.network** - works

**If anything doesn't work:**
