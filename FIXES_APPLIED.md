This document outlines all the fixes applied to resolve issues with the MyCo Network website.

## 1. ✅ Fixed Mobile Menu Page Scrolling Issue

### Problem
When the mobile navigation menu was open, the page could still be scrolled beneath it, creating a poor user experience.

### Solution
**File Modified:** `src/components/Navigation/Header.tsx`

Added a `useEffect` hook that:
- Disables body scrolling by setting `document.body.style.overflow = "hidden"` when the mobile menu is open
- Sets `document.body.style.height = "100vh"` to prevent scroll
- Properly cleans up styles when the menu closes
- Restores scrolling functionality when the menu is closed

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isMobileMenuOpen) {
    document.body.style.overflow = "hidden";
    document.body.style.height = "100vh";
  } else {
    document.body.style.overflow = "unset";
    document.body.style.height = "unset";
  }
  
  return () => {
    document.body.style.overflow = "unset";
    document.body.style.height = "unset";
  };
}, [isMobileMenuOpen]);
```

**Result:** Mobile menu now properly locks the page scroll, providing a professional mobile experience.

## 4. ✅ Updated Footer with Legal Links

### Problem
Footer had placeholder buttons for Privacy Policy and Terms of Service that didn't navigate anywhere.

### Solution

Changes:
- Added `import Link from "next/link"`
- Replaced button elements with Next.js `Link` components
- Updated Privacy Policy link to: `/privacy`
- Updated Terms of Service link to: `/terms`

**Before:**
```tsx
<button className="...">Privacy Policy</button>
<button className="...">Terms of Service</button>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<Link href="/privacy" className="...">Privacy Policy</Link>
<Link href="/terms" className="...">Terms of Service</Link>
```

**Result:** Users can now click on footer links to view legal documents.
