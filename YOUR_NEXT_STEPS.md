## üöÄ What You Need to Do (3 Simple Steps!)

### STEP 1: Install Google Cloud CLI (15 minutes)

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Download and install from:
# https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install

# Or use Chocolatey:
choco install gcloudsdk

# Then restart PowerShell and verify:
gcloud --version
```

---

### STEP 2: Set Up Google Cloud (10 minutes)

```powershell
# 1. Log in
gcloud auth login

# 2. Create project
gcloud projects create myconsulting-network --name="MyConsulting Network"
gcloud config set project myconsulting-network

# 3. Link billing (get your billing ID first)
gcloud billing accounts list
gcloud billing projects link myconsulting-network --billing-account=YOUR-BILLING-ID

# 4. Enable APIs
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com containerregistry.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com
```

---

### STEP 3: Deploy! (5 minutes + waiting for DNS)

```powershell
# Navigate to your project
cd D:\myco-website

# Deploy with PowerShell script (easiest)
.\deploy-to-gcloud.ps1

# OR deploy manually
gcloud run deploy myconsulting-network --source . --region=us-central1 --allow-unauthenticated
```

**That's it!** Your site will be live in 5-10 minutes.

---

## üåê Then Connect Your Domain (5 minutes + 1-24 hours waiting)

After deployment:

```powershell
# 1. Map domain in Google Cloud
gcloud run domain-mappings create --service=myconsulting-network --domain=myconsulting.network --region=us-central1
gcloud run domain-mappings create --service=myconsulting-network --domain=www.myconsulting.network --region=us-central1

# 2. Get DNS records to add
gcloud run domain-mappings describe myconsulting.network --region=us-central1
```

Then go to Squarespace and add the DNS records (see SQUARESPACE_DNS_SETUP.md for details).

## üí∞ Cost Breakdown

### First 90 Days:
- **$300 free credit** from Google Cloud
- **Effectively:** $0

### After Free Credit:
- **Monthly cost:** $0-5 (usually $0)
