## 🌐 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended for Next.js)

1. **Push to GitHub** (already done)
2. **Connect Netlify**:
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Select your GitHub repository
   - Build settings:
     - Build command: `npm run build`
     - Publish directory: `.next`
     - Node version: 18.x or higher
3. **Deploy**: Netlify will auto-deploy on every push

**Custom Domain Setup**:
- In Netlify: Domain settings → Add custom domain
- Point your Squarespace domain to Netlify
- Add DNS records as instructed by Netlify

### Option 2: Vercel (Best for Next.js)

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Auto-detects Next.js settings
4. Deploy
5. Add custom domain in project settings

### Option 3: Squarespace with Custom Code

**Note**: Squarespace doesn't natively support Next.js. You'll need to:

1. Build static export:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run export
   ```
2. Upload the `out` folder to Squarespace
3. **Limitation**: Some Next.js features won't work

**Recommendation**: Use Netlify or Vercel, then point your Squarespace domain to it.
